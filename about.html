            <div class="quotecontent">
                <p>Hi every one! I am Steven Niu, a current freshman in Cornell University, major in Information science and Mathematics. I pursue minimalism as my lifestyle, believing that it's the way for us to maximize happiness. I love writing, playing guitar in bands, reading, swimming, and playing rhythm games. This site is for you to know more about me, and for me to know more about myself as well. </p>
                <p>You will never know who you are until you find a place for self-expression.</p>
                <p>So this is the PLACE for me.
                </p>
