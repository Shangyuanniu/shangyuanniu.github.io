<p>March
1, 2011 - I came across a post on the school forum with this ambiguous title.
It is from a familiar user, so I click into it only to discover an empty post.
Skimming across the meaningless comments from other users, I smile before
clicking the red X on the upright corner. Must be the academic stress of the
season.</p>

<p>I
have connected with him several times before without knowing who he really is
at school--once to clarify the "monotonicity" of derivative functions, and
another time debating over the effectiveness of a new school policy on mobile
phones. Each time, he managed to convince me with his insightful reasoning.
From our conversations, I deemed him an interesting person, amongst those few we
encounter in life. However, beyond the whimsical discussions online, we never
interacted further.</p>

<p>A
month later, I clicked into the same post again, to find an outpour of comments
like "Saddened" and "He was so young. Why?" A sense of foreboding spilled from
my gut, for the day before, a senior student had jumped from a school building
and died. I did not dwell on it too much when I first heard the news, because after
all, suicides are the leading cause of death amongst high school students in
China, common knowledge to us. We'	ve learned to tune out those news before they
can distract us from the important examinations. But that was before I found
out it was him.</p>

<p>Scrolling
down the page rereading our shared discussions, a sense of hollowness manifested,
knowing that his voice no longer existed.</p>

<p><span class=italicized>"Your
idea reminds me of 'Brain in a vat', an interesting thought experiment. Yet following
the principle of Occam's razor, I choose not to believe in it."</span></p>

<p><span class=italicized>"I
also can't wait to watch the new season of Big Bang!"</span></p>

<p><span class=italicized>"Cheers
for Lakers!"</span></p>

<p>On
his profile page, I found this surreptitious greeting: "Welcome! I wish you
happiness everyday." I wonder what he was thinking when he typed those
words. Perhaps the word 'happiness' for him was just polite greeting. But I
really yearn to go back and wake him up, to tell him it's more than that. Happiness
is the feeling of waking up in the morning to see breakfast made by mum. Happiness
is solving a Rubik's cube a little faster than the last time. Happiness is practicing
ensemble with friends, enjoying sweet music on a Sunday. It is everywhere in
daily life. Why couldn't he see that?</p>

<p><span class=italicized>"My
life is like a play, which at the moment lack funds, performers, and script."</span></p>

<p>The
support from your family and friends are the biggest funds; You yourself are
the most extraordinary performer; And script? The best script in the world is
there all along--your experiences overcoming challenges, finding love, and building
accomplishments are what define it. Everyone has an awesome script waiting to
be experienced.</p>

<p>But it's
just a wish to tell him all this, because I cannot travel through time.
Instead, two year have passed. Every time I see friends or classmates
despairing about their current situation, I would think of him, and I will make
sure to remind them that the world is not that tough--not because there are few
difficulties, but because there is an even better future waiting for us to
discover and realize. Even difficulties can be enjoyed, because difficulties only
make growth and happiness that much better. It's only that sometimes, we need
to be reminded of it, and that's what I'm for. </p>

<p>For you,
I will try my best to play my role on my life's stage.</p>
