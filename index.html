		<p>People look at the sky and at the other animals. They make beautiful objects, beautiful sounds, beautiful motions of their bodies beating drums in lines. They pray; they toss people in peat bogs; they help the sick and injured; they pierce their lips, their noses, ears; they make the same mistakes despite religion, written language, philosophy, and science; they build, they kill, they preserve, they count and figure, they boil the pot, they keep the embers alive; they tell their stories and gird themselves.</p>
		<p>Will knowledge you experience directly make you a Buddhist? Must you forfeit excitement per se? To what end?</p>
		<p>Say you have seen something. You have seen an ordinary bit of
		what is real, the infinite fabric of time that eternity shoots through,
		and time's soft-skinned people working and dying under slowly shifting stars.
		</p>
		<p>Then what?</p>
