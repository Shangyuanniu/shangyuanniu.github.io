		<p><span class=italicized>In the past several years
there is an impulse that influences my decisions, including my decision to
study abroad. Yet I cannot figure out what it is. It bothers me so I decide to try
a unique method from Steve Pavlina to address it.</span></p>


<p>I close the window and
curtains, preventing even a single beam of sunlight from entering. I turn off Bach's
organ concerto that has been playing on my sound box, along with my cell phone and
computer. The room is drenched in complete darkness and silence, inducing a
serene paradise for introspection.</p>

<p>On a large piece of paper,
I scrawl blindly, "WHAT DO I WANT IN LIFE?" I feel funny about what I am doing--thinking
about such big matters in such big letters. My mood then is light-hearted.</p>

<p>I am required to write
down the first thing from my mind, repeating until I feel finished.</p>

<p>I had pizza for lunch, my
favorite food, so I wrote: "Have pizza every day."</p>

<p>It's not hard at all. I
smiled skeptically, but continued.</p>

<p>"Play rhythm games all day."
"A room full of guitars--classical, electronic and folk guitars." "Watch sci-fi
movies like Matrix and Star Wars."</p>

<p>I realized I was
substituting the original question with a less abstract, "What makes you happy?"
</p>

<p>It's rather misleading; I want
things that make me happy, but it's more than pizza.</p>


<p>I take a deep breath.</p>

<p>I recall the euphoria from
unraveling intricacies like algebra problems or Rubik's cube, but particularly
from books detailing the most profound obscurities of life. As the eyes traverse
the lines, stalking the contemplations of the writer, the mind is provoked,
challenged, and molded. </p>

<p>From <span class=italicized>Amusing Ourselves
to Death, </span>I was appalled at the effortless sway of media on society's
subconscious, which instilled in me the duty of responsible journalism that I strive
to impart in <span class=italicized>Nirvana Weekly<span>. From <span class=italicized>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the
Galaxy,</span> I now know that the ultimate answer to the universe is 42.</p>


<p>I once came across Schopenhauer's
claim that "one can do what he will, but in any given moment of life one can WILL
only definite things." In other words, our decisions are limited to possibilities
we can conceive, in turn limited by what we know. I contemplated this idea, and
wrote down: "I never want to stop broadening my range of cognition through
learning and experience."</p>

<p>Well, what next?</p>

<p>I recall a stranger I met in
Shanghai, along an old road in The Bund. "Thank you for taking this photo of me.
Although this may be the only time we will ever meet in our lifetime, I hope
you will remember my face, and I will remember yours, to appreciate the powers
of fate." It invoked a strange melancholy towards all the strangers in my life
I'll never see again.</p>


<p>Another time in Lucerne, a street violinist
casually mentioned, "Wouldn't you agree it's like heaven here, standing in the
breeze and sunshine, enjoying your own music, while appreciating the lovely
smiles of passersby?" Indeed it was the most memorable moment of my trip.</p>

<p>And once, while my roommate and I were brushing our teeth: "Did
you know the Klein Bottle is a three-dimensional counterpart of the M&ouml;bius
Strip? Except we'll never see the Klein Bottle's real four-dimensional form besides through abstract
math formulas. Isn't that a pity?"</p>

<p>These moments leave
lasting impressions on me, reminding me of the stories and ideas that are lost
forever if I hesitate to seize them. So I wrote down: "I NEVER want to stop
connecting with others."</p>

<p>But that isn't enough. I desire
to spread this attitude to remind everyone to slow down for the fleeting stories
and ideas present in everyday life. They may be simple beauty of life worth remembering,
ideas worth spreading, or perhaps opportunities to make a difference. If everyone
listened, the world will become a different place.</p>
