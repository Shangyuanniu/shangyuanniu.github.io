		<div class="quotecontent">
		<p>Question: The mantis shrimp can perceive both polarized light and multispectral images; they have the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom. Human eyes have color receptors for three colors (red, green, and blue); the mantis shrimp has receptors for sixteen types of color, enabling them to see a spectrum far beyond the capacity of the human brain. Seriously, how cool is the mantis shrimp: mantisshrimp.uchicago.edu What might they be able to see that we cannot? What are we missing?</p>
		<p>Interestingly,
the three color receptors humans possess happen to coincide with the number of
dimensions in space, so therefore humans can be considered 3-dimensional beings
of both space and color. Under this definition, mantis shrimps would be living
in a 16-dimensional world of vision. Considering that human beings cannot grasp
higher dimensional space, we likewise cannot grasp the world of the mantis
shrimp. We can never understand the vision of the world of the mantis shrimp because
that's beyond our comprehension limits. Thus, whether its world is shining with
iridescent light, filled with heavenly rainbows or not, we will never know.</p>

<p>If
we inspect deeper though, visible light, like other electromagnetic waves, really
have no characteristics of so-called "color". All perceptions of colors are
actually transmuted, edited by the brain to form our vision. To this extent
human and mantis shrimp are similar--both of us are actually seeing what our
brain shows us. Hence seeing becomes a subjective matter--nothing to do with
number of receptors but with how the brain interprets the signals the receptors
receive.</p>

<p>Even if
the mantis shrimp can really see a much more wonderful world than ours, it may
not possess the ability to interpret much of it.</p>

<p>Humans
may have a visual system not as good as that of the shrimp's, but we are gifted
with the mind's ability to attach emotions and memories to visual stimulants. By
laying my eyes on the old wall of Florence, I was able to connect with history
and "see" the old magnificent days of Italy, kings and bishops
walking down the marble stairs. The scene evoked a sense of awe yet melancholy--all
the grandiose, all the vicissitudes, were all annihilated by time, only walls
remains. Seeing is not about eyes, it's about mind and heart.</p>

<p>The
savant effect of psychology states that when you discard your vision, you gain
something in the other aspect. Our powerful minds compensate for our "lack" of
vision; we do not miss anything. </p>


<p>I
once read a story from the NATGEO magazine written by an astronomer,
demonstrating the profound extents of our senses, and I believe it serves as a
perfect conclusion: "The sound of crunching rocks startled me. A few feet away
three wild horses, black on black against the nightscape, wandered past. They
never glanced skyward at the gossamer swath of Hale-Bopp nor at the wondrous
spectacle that is the night sky on a clear night, comet or no.</p>


<p>It is good to be human."</p>
